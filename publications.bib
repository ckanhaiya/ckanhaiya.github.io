	abstract = {Cabin pressure control system of an aircraft maintains cabin pressure in all flight modes as per the aircraft cabin pressurization characteristics by controlling the air flow from the cabin through the outflow valve of the cabin pressure control valve. The movement of outflow valve in turn depends on the air flow from the control chamber of cabin pressure control valve, which is controlled by the clapper and the poppet valves. These valves are actuated by absolute pressure and the differential pressure capsules, respectively depending upon the operating flight conditions. Mathematical models have been developed to simulate the air outflow rates from the cabin and the control chamber of cabin pressure control valve during steady-state and transient flight conditions. These mathematical models have then been translated into a MATLAB program to obtain plots of cabin pressures as a function of aircraft altitudes. The mathematical models are validated for standard cabin pressurization characteristics of a multirole light fighter/trainer aircraft. The model developed, thus can be used to produce a number of variants of cabin pressure control valve to suit different cabin pressurization characteristics.},

            Actuators are ubiquitous to generate controlled motion through the application of suitable excitation force or torque to perform various operations in manufacturing and industrial automation. The demands placed on faster, smaller, and efficient actuators drive innovation in actuator development. Shape memory alloy (SMA) based actuators have multiple advantages over conventional actuators, including high power-to-weight ratio. This paper integrates the advantages of pennate muscle of a biological system and the unique properties of SMA to develop SMA-based bipennate actuator. The present study explores and expands on the previous SMA actuators by developing the mathematical model of the new actuator based on the bipennate arrangement of the SMA wires and experimentally validating it. The new actuator is found to deliver at least five times higher actuation forces (up to 150 N) in comparison to the reported SMA-based actuators. The corresponding weight reduction is about 67\%. The results from the sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model facilitates customization of the design parameters and understanding critical parameters. This study further introduces an Nth level hierarchical actuator that can be deployed for further amplification of actuation forces. The SMA-based bipennate muscle actuator has broad applications ranging from building automation controls to precise drug delivery systems.},

	abstract = {The invention discloses a speed control system for Pipe Health Monitoring Robot (PHMR) during pigging operation. The system design offers the dual-integration of bypass leakage flow and hydro-mechanical brake mechanisms. The control system so developed exploits centrifugal rotation of an array of a spring-mass system to control hydraulic brakes and the opening of the slots of the back- plate to control the drag force acting on the system. This integration makes the system versatile and more responsive to the sudden change in the travel speed of the PHMR. Thus, by virtue of these mechanisms, the PHMR experiences constant speed during its movement inside the gas pipeline. This will help in effective, accurate and seamless inspection of the gas pipelines spread over a large network area.},
