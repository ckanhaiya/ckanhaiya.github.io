I am so glad to be invited as a Speaker at the [YNU International Symposium 2022](https://global.ynu.ac.jp/en/strategies/yokohama-sxip/) at [Yokohama National University](https://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/). It is a part of the India-Japan Collaborative Education program supported by the MEXT-JSPS based on the theme "Sustainability Transformation to a Resilient Society."

Got a platform and opportunity to share our ongoing research and interact with the eminent faculty members and the participants at the event.
