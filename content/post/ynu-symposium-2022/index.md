### About the Symposium: [YOKOHAMA-SXIP](https://ijep-y.ynu.ac.jp/english/symposium/YNUIS2022/)

YNU’s proposal “Yokohama International Education Program for Leading Sustainability Transformation towards a Resilient Society with Industry-Government-Academia Network” was accepted by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) as an “[INTER-UNIVERSITY EXCHANGE PROJECT](https://global.ynu.ac.jp/en/strategies/yokohama-sxip/)” in FY2022.
 In collaboration with partner universities in India and Australia, an international collaborative learning program will be established to enable international and cross-disciplinary student teams to proactively develop plans and engage in interactive exchanges to solve global issues.

- Organized by **YOKOHAMA-SXIP Organizing Committee**
- Supported by **MEXT-JSPS “INTER- UNIVERSITY EXCHANGE PROJECT”**
- Date: **December 21st - 22nd, 2022**
- Venue: **Yokohama National University, Japan**

### Scope and Topics
The environment surrounding us is rapidly changing due to global environmental issues such as global warming, changes in industrial structure caused by technological advancements, and epidemics of new coronaviruses. By interacting directly with students and faculty from overseas, both in person and online, the symposium will provide an opportunity for global interactions across disciplines and to understand each other's values. We hope that this symposium will provide an opportunity for new exchanges among the participants and their research colleagues.
