Happy to announce that we have been granted an Indian patent for our invention, **Compressed Air-Driven Hyperloop Mobility System for Transporting Goods/Cargo.**

This innovative system utilizes automated cargo modules driven by compressed air within underground pipes, offering a novel and efficient solution for urban bulk goods transportation.

Thanks to the generous support from [Central Mine Planning & Design Institute](https://scienceandtech.cmpdi.co.in/), we are currently conducting a techno-commercial feasibility study to explore its application for first-mile coal transportation. This system promises to revolutionize surface coal transport by providing an alternative to traditional methods like trucks, conveyors, and trains, connecting coal mines to user agencies seamlessly.

Our research and development efforts have been expertly guided by [Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya](https://www.iitk.ac.in/smss/#about), IIT Kanpur. We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to [Prof. Abhay Karandikar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karandi65/), who has been a visionary promoter of this technology during his tenure as Director of IIT Kanpur.
