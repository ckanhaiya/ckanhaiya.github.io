The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), recently concluded its **Annual Sports Meet 2025**, which was a resounding success! The event saw active participation from faculty, students, and staff, fostering an environment of healthy interaction and fun. 

I am grateful to have won a **Gold** medal ðŸ¥‡ in the 400m race and a **Bronze** medal ðŸ¥‰ in the 200m race. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect with peers and mentors outside the academic setting.

The *SportsMeet* underscored the importance of sports and physical fitness in our lives. A big thank you to everyone who participated and contributed to making this event memorable. Let's continue to prioritize our *health* and *fitness* as we strive for excellence in our academic and professional endeavors.
