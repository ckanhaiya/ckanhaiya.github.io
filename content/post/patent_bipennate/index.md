Super excited to announce the grant of my first patent on a **“Bipennate Muscle Architecture based SMA Actuator.”** The research team, under the guidance of [Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya](https://www.iitk.ac.in/smss/#about), has expanded the design space of the SMA actuator by leveraging the characteristics of bi-pennate muscle architecture with about 70% enhanced muscle force output per unit weight.

The invention is best suited to cater to the industry demand in the field of miniature, lightweight, non-magnetic gear-free actuators with an excellent power-to-weight ratio as a suitable alternative to conventional actuation systems. 

It has broad applications ranging from building automation controls and bionic autonomous underwater vehicles to healthcare robotics. The use of the technology will foster higher utilization rates for a broad-band of gripping force and hence a better cost-benefit ratio. This will create a new class of Space Robots that will reinforce Indian Space Technology.
