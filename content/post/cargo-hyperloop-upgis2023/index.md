Recently, I got an opportunity to participate in the [Invest UP 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/company/upinvestors-summit/), Lucknow. The 3-day long Summit provided us the platform to interact with policymakers, corporate leaders, think tanks, and government leaders from across the globe to explore business opportunities and academia-industry collaborations.

We showcased some of our lab cutting-edge innovations and technologies developed pertaining to "Emerging avenues of Pipe Following Robot: From Structural Health Monitoring to Cargo Mobility Solutions."
