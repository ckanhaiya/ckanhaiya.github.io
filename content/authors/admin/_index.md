Born and raised in [Varanasi](https://varanasi.nic.in/), the world's oldest living city on the _River Ganges_, my journey has been one of relentless pursuit toward research excellence.  Currently, I am a doctoral candidate at [D Lab - IISc Bangalore](https://d3lab-iisc.github.io/), where my research focuses on developing machine learning frameworks to perform inverse parameter identification for different class of materials.


With eight years of combined industrial and research experience, I have led innovative projects at [SMSS Lab - IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/smss/), including the development of an SMA-powered bionic arm, variable stiffness actuators, pipe health monitoring robots, and cargo hyperloop mobility systems. Outside of work, I am passionate about wall climbing and participate in 5/10km runs. I also enjoy floral and astrophotography, capturing the beauty of nature and the cosmos.
