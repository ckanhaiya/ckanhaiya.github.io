abstract: A bipennate muscle architecture-based shape memory alloy embedded hierarchical
  actuator is disclosed. The shape memory alloy embedded hierarchical actuator (100)
  comprises plurality of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires (110), a movable subassembly
  (122), a left fixture (102), a right fixture (104), a plunger (116), a spring connector
  (114), a base (120) and the like. The movable subassembly (122) comprises a top
  plate (106) and a bottom plate (108). The spring connector (114) is configured to
  support arrangement of bias springs (112). The left fixture (102) is configured
  to hold one end of the plurality of SMA wires (110) using a plurality of terminal
  crimps (118).
