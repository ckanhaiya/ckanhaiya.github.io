 abstract = {The invention discloses a speed control system for Pipe Health Monitoring Robot (PHMR) during pigging operation. The system design offers the dual-integration of bypass leakage flow and hydro-mechanical brake mechanisms. The control system so developed exploits centrifugal rotation of an array of a spring-mass system to control hydraulic brakes and the opening of the slots of the back- plate to control the drag force acting on the system. This integration makes the system versatile and more responsive to the sudden change in the travel speed of the PHMR. Thus, by virtue of these mechanisms, the PHMR experiences constant speed during its movement inside the gas pipeline. This will help in effective, accurate and seamless inspection of the gas pipelines spread over a large network area.},
