abstract: The invention discloses a speed control system for Pipe Health Monitoring
  Robot (PHMR) during pigging operation. The system design offers the dual-integration
  of bypass leakage flow and hydro-mechanical brake mechanisms. The control system
  so developed exploits centrifugal rotation of an array of a spring-mass system to
  control hydraulic brakes and the opening of the slots of the back- plate to control
  the drag force acting on the system. This integration makes the system versatile
  and more responsive to the sudden change in the travel speed of the PHMR. Thus,
  by virtue of these mechanisms, the PHMR experiences constant speed during its movement
  inside the gas pipeline. This will help in effective, accurate and seamless inspection
  of the gas pipelines spread over a large network area.
