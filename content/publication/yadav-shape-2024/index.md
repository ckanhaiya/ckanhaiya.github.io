abstract: A shape memory alloy-based device with enhanced rotational motion (100) for converting reciprocating motion into rotational motion that includes a housing (102) with a base platform (104) and is a rotary member pivotally coupled on the base platform (104) and configured to move between a first and a second position; at least one connecting link (108) coupled to the rotary member (106) and a coil holder (110) through an attachment means (112); a thermally sensitive coil (114) positioned between the coil holder (110) and the rotary member (106), contracting and expanding with temperature changes induced by cooling (116) and heating units. The coil holder (110) is configured on guide bars (118), enabling slidable movement between the two positions which is transferred to the rotary member (106) through the connecting link (108), converting the linear motion of the coils (114) into rotational motion with increased torque and increased frequency.
