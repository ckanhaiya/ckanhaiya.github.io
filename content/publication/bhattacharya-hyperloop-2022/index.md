abstract: A hyperloop transportation system (100) for transporting goods, is disclosed.
  The hyperloop transportation system (100) includes a pipeline (102), and a robot
  vehicle (104). The pipeline (102) includes guided rails (114) adapting the robot
  vehicle to travel within pipeline (102). The vehicle control system (106) controls
  the robot vehicle (104) using fluid flow deflector (204), and transmission and braking
  system (202). The fluid flow deflector provides force to the robot vehicle (104)
  for accelerating the robot vehicle (104), based on compressed fluid flow across
  the pipeline (102) by an air compressor (712). The transmission and braking system
  (202) controls movements of robot vehicle (104). At least two wheel assemblies are
  arranged on at least two sides of the wagon (108). Each wheel assembly includes
  wheels arranged to pass on the guided rails (114) for adapting the robot vehicle
  (104) to travel within the pipeline (102).
