abstract: Abstract Actuators are ubiquitous to generate controlled motion through
  the application of suitable excitation force or torque to perform various operations
  in manufacturing and industrial automation. The demands placed on faster, smaller,
  and efficient actuators drive innovation in actuator development. Shape memory alloy
  (SMA) based actuators have multiple advantages over conventional actuators, including
  high power-to-weight ratio. This paper integrates the advantages of pennate muscle
  of a biological system and the unique properties of SMA to develop SMA-based bipennate
  actuator. The present study explores and expands on the previous SMA actuators by
  developing the mathematical model of the new actuator based on the bipennate arrangement
  of the SMA wires and experimentally validating it. The new actuator is found to
  deliver at least five times higher actuation forces (up to 150 N) in comparison
  to the reported SMA-based actuators. The corresponding weight reduction is about
  67%. The results from the sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model facilitates
  customization of the design parameters and understanding critical parameters. This
  study further introduces an Nth level hierarchical actuator that can be deployed
  for further amplification of actuation forces. The SMA-based bipennate muscle actuator
  has broad applications ranging from building automation controls to precise drug
  delivery systems.
