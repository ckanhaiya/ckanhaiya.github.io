abstract: Cabin pressure control system of an aircraft maintains cabin pressure in
  all flight modes as per the aircraft cabin pressurization characteristics by controlling
  the air flow from the cabin through the outflow valve of the cabin pressure control
  valve. The movement of outflow valve in turn depends on the air flow from the control
  chamber of cabin pressure control valve, which is controlled by the clapper and
  the poppet valves. These valves are actuated by absolute pressure and the differential
  pressure capsules, respectively depending upon the operating flight conditions.
  Mathematical models have been developed to simulate the air outflow rates from the
  cabin and the control chamber of cabin pressure control valve during steady-state
  and transient flight conditions. These mathematical models have then been translated
  into a MATLAB program to obtain plots of cabin pressures as a function of aircraft
  altitudes. The mathematical models are validated for standard cabin pressurization
  characteristics of a multirole light fighter/trainer aircraft. The model developed,
  thus can be used to produce a number of variants of cabin pressure control valve
  to suit different cabin pressurization characteristics.
