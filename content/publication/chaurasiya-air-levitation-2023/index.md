abstract: An air-levitation based hyperloop transporting system (100) for transporting
  goods, is disclosed. The air-levitation based hyperloop transporting system (100)
  includes pipelines (102), and a robot vehicle (104). The pipeline (102) includes
  air-duct rails (106) to generate a first air cushion based on a first fluid flow
  (110) with a first predefined pressure applied within the air duct rails (106).
  The robot vehicle (104) includes fluid flow deflectors (112), wagons (114), vertical
  blocks (116) with follower flaps (118). When the vertical blocks (116) is levitated
  on the first air cushion generated on the air duct rails (106), the fluid flow deflectors
  (112) is configured to provide driving pressure force to the robot vehicles (104)
  for accelerating the robot vehicles (104) in a direction of a second fluid flow
  (120) within the pipelines (102), by applying the second fluid flow (120) with the
  second predefined pressure across the pipelines (102).
