@patent{bhattacharya_actuator_2021,
 abstract = {An assembly includes a frame configured to couple to a valve, an actuating arm movably coupled to the frame and configured to move a movable component of the valve to adjust a position of the movable component, and a biasing member coupled to the actuating arm and the frame. The biasing member is configured to bias the actuating arm in a first direction relative to the frame. The assembly further includes one or more shape memory alloy (SMA) elements coupled to the actuating arm and the frame. Responsive to an activation that causes the one or more SMA elements undergo a dimensional transformation, the one or more SMA elements are configured to operate against the biasing member to bias the actuating arm in a second direction opposite the first direction relative to the frame.},
